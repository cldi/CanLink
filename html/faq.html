  canadiennes</h2>
Can Link - a linked data project for Canadian theses / CanaLien : un projet de données liées pour les thèses canadiennes is a proof of concept project of the Digital Projects Working Group of the Canadian Linked Data Initiative (https://connect.library.utoronto.ca/display/U5LD/Canadian+Linked+Data+Initiative+Home). 

Its goal is to increase the discoverability of Canadian theses and dissertations by leveraging the power of linked data to surface unexpected connections and relationships. 

Participating institutions are: University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, Library and Archives Canada/Bibliothèque et Archives Canada, Queens University, University of Toronto, McGill University, Université de Montréal, Memorial University of Newfoundland.
