  <h2 class="center">CanLink : a linked data project for Canadian theses</h2> 
  Can Link - a linked data project for Canadian theses 
is a proof of concept project of the Digital Projects Working Group of the <a href="https://connect.library.utoronto.ca/display/U5LD/Canadian+Linked+Data+Initiative+Home">
Canadian Linked Data Initiative - Digital Projects Working Group of the Canadian Linked Data Initiative</a>.

Its goal is to increase the discoverability of Canadian theses and
dissertations by leveraging the power of linked data to surface unexpected
connections and relationships.

Participating institutions are: University of British Columbia, University
of Alberta, Library and Archives Canada/Bibliothèque et Archives Canada,
Queens University, University of Toronto, McGill University, Université de
Montréal, Memorial University of Newfoundland.

<h4>Q: What data is included in the project? </h4>

<p>A: The data included are subsets of records for dissertations and theses
that have a publicly available digital object.  Library and Archives
Canada/Bibliothèque et Archives Canada are a subset of those found in the
<a href="https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/theses/Pages/theses-canada.aspx">Theses Canada
Portal</a>.</p>
 
<h4>Q: Can I contribute records to the project? </h4>

<p>A: Yes!  The goal of the project was to start with a small set of records so
we could refine and document our processes, and then ask others to join in! 
If you would like to submit records we’d love to hear from you!</p>

<h4>Q: Who can I contact for further information? </h4>

<p>A: For further information on the project or to get involved, please email
Sharon Farnel (sharondotfarnel at ualbertadotca) or Rob Warren
(rwarren at muninn-projectdotorg).</p>


<h4>Q: What is the long term plan for the project? </h4>

<p>A: This initial phase is to pilot and document processes and workflows, as
well as potential infrastructure.  We are working with the Canadian Linked
Data Initiative and other research groups on a long-term, sustainable plan
for the project to continue to grow and thrive.  More details will be
announced as they become finalized.</p>

<h4>Q: Can I download the data?</h4> 

<p>A: Data dumps are available for download at <a
